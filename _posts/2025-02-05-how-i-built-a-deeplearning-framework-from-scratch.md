# How I built an entire DeepLearning framework from scratch

## Introduction

The best way to finally understand a concept is to built it with your own hand. As I wanted to clearly understand the machine, I took of my time to build an entire homemade DeepLearning framework.

## Prerequisite

Being familiar with matrix calculations, object oriented programming and a programming language is a plus.
If not you may not be able to fully understand the following concepts.

## Objectives

Todays objectives:
- Understand the underlying concepts behind the neural network keyword
- Build an entire DeepLearning framework from scratch
- Train fully-connected models
- And finally, infer from data

## Uderstand the untold secrets behind overmystified neural network

### A biological neuron

A biological neuron is composed of dendrites, a cell body and an axon. It receives many electrical signal from the dendrites. The neuron will sum the electrical signals and if the result exceed its activation threshold, then it will generate an electrical signal on its axon.

### A neural network

Now for the purpose of the course, let's assume a neural network is simply a lot of neurons connected together.
